# Introduction #
The sensor node provides remote sensor functionality based on the ATmega8 and nRF24L01.  The design objective is to create an inexpensive sensor nodes that will report sensor readings at a regular interval set during configuration.
To work, a sensor host/server is required to capture the sensor network data.

The project will roughly follow these activities:
  * Concept testing/design study
  * Develop hardware prototype
  * Develop software
  * Real world testing
